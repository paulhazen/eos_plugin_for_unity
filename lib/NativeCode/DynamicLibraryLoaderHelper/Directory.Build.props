      Across different contexts and different conditions WITHIN THIS PROJECT, 
      "Win32" and "x86" are used somewhat interchangeably. For the purposes of 
      the native component of the plugin, Win32 is considered to be x86 and 
      should be placed in the corresponding directory along with other x86 
      binaries.

      Therefore NormalizedPlatform is introduced here to appropriately 
      translate.
